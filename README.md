##### Executive Summary  

GMM-based oversampling improved recall by capturing more fraud cases but caused a severe drop in precision, leading to an impractical surge in false positives.  
While theoretically appealing, GMM fails to generate truly representative synthetic samples in this context, making it less effective than baseline or hybrid alternatives.  
For fraud detection, cost-sensitive methods or threshold tuning are recommended over GMM-based oversampling.
